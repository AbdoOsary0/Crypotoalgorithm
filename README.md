# Cryptography Algorithms

A collection of cryptographic algorithms implemented from scratch using Python / Java.  
This project is for learning, educational use, and understanding how core algorithms work.

## Features

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Caesar Cipher
- Vigen√®re Cipher
- RSA (coming soon)
- Custom key expansion and S-Box generation (AES)
- GUI for encryption/decryption using JavaFX (for AES)

## Tech Stack

- Java / JavaFX
- Python (for simple prototypes)
- No external cryptography libraries used (manual implementation)
